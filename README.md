# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. It is a 2-player game where Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O'. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is for a player to place three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win.

## How to Play
1.The game starts with Player 1 ('X') making the first move.

2.Players take turns choosing a slot (numbered 1-9) to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').

3.The board is displayed after each move, showing the updated state.

4.The first player to align three of their symbols in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

5.If all slots are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.
